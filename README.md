## About Me. 

I am a first year machine learning PhD student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://ml.gatech.edu/) and a researcher at [DuckAI](https://github.com/TheDuckAI), [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/), and [CarperAI](https://carper.ai/). I am broadly interested in techniques that improve reasoning capabilities in language models (including but not limited to [RLHF](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf)). 

Previously, I studied mathematics at the University of Chicago. 


## Recent Work. 

Here are some recent projects: 

### [DuckAI Academic Benchmark](https://github.com/TheDuckAI/DUCK-datasets) 


## Miscellany.
