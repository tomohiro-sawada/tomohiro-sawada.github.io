### About.

I am a machine learning PhD student at [Georgia Tech](https://ml.gatech.edu). I am also a researcher at 
[DuckAI](https://duckai.org/), 
[EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/), and 
[CarperAI](https://carper.ai/). 
My research interests center around 
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models, 
particularly in the realm of mathematical reasoning, 
and exploring the potential of multimodal models.
