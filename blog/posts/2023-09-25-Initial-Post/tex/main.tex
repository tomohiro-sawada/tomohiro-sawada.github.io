\section*{Initial Post.}

The purpose of this blog is to serve as a repository for things 
I learn throughout graduate school. More concretely, I would like to accomplish two things: 


\begin{enumerate}
    \item Unify existing expositions into a single narrative: 
    Even for topics where there are already excellent expositions,
    I find it useful to paraphrase, reorganize, and occasionally add my own explanation.
    \item Fill in gaps in the expository literature: 
    I think some topics are harder to learn not by nature 
    but by absence of a good exposition. I aspire to fill in these gaps. 
\end{enumerate}

These are tentative aspirations, and I make no promise to strictly adhere to them in the future.
